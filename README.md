This data visualization was a short experiment on translating the cost of healthcare to sound. 

The data was obtained from calculating the cost of health insurance premiums for the median age person, with the median income in each major US city. The cost was then translated to what the weight would be in pennies. From there, I took samples of people lifting that corresponding weight. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I have.
